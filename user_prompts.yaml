      The logic for finding the transcript path is wrong. The path is passed in by Claude Code by default. See: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks#notification-input

      Please, fix how the transcript file path is determined. There is no need for a CLAUDE_TRANSCRIPT_PATH environment variable at all.

      Have you read the link I shared with you?!

      This is the input format hooks will receive as an argument:

      {
        "session_id": "abc123",
        "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
        "cwd": "/Users/...",
        "hook_event_name": "Notification",
        "message": "Task completed successfully"
      }

      Parse the argument as JSON, and get the transcript_path from there! Think hard to accomplish what I'm asking for!

      You need something like: event_data = json.load(sys.stdin). Think through your whole parser setup in main as it's likely wrong!
