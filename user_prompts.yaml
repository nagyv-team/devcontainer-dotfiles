      The logic for finding the transcript path is wrong. The path is passed in by Claude Code by default. See: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks#notification-input

      Please, fix how the transcript file path is determined. There is no need for a CLAUDE_TRANSCRIPT_PATH environment variable at all.
