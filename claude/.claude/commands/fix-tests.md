Failing tests are not acceptable!

1. Run the tests, and take a note of every failing test
2. Set up a todo using TodoWriter to analyse every failing test
3. Analyze the failing tests following the todos: is it an implementation issue? a mocking issue? is the test wrong/outdated?
4. Document your analysis for every test and share it with the user
5. Wait for user feedback on how to proceed with fixing the tests
6. Set up a todo using TodoWriter to fix tests 1-by-1
7. Start fixing the tests

Use related BDD and TDD agents as needed for the analyses and fixing steps
