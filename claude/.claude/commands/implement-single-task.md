Implement task $ARGUMENTS.

## Rules

Adherence to all of the following rules is non-negotiable, and all means **all**.

- **One task at a time:**
  Follow the task breakdown from the issue description. Only implement Task 0!
- **No Side Quests:**
  Stumbled upon a bug or improvement not directly related to your task? Let the human know and decide what to do with it. Don't get distracted.
- **Comment Wisely:**
  Avoid Captain Obvious style comments. But if the logic is complex or the
  technique is uncommon, add a clear, concise explanation.
- **Leave the final decision to humans:**
  Open the related PR as you are ready with your task, but do not merge it.
- **Keep everyone informerd:**
  Post updates to the issue after your task as issue comments.
- **No task is left behind:**
  Do NOT stop until you are done with the task in the issue, except if you got blocked by some external factor.
