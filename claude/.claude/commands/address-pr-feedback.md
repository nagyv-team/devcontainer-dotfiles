## Rules

Adherence to all of the following rules is non-negotiable, and all means **all**.

- **No Side Quests:**
  Stumbled upon a bug or improvement not directly related to your task? Let the human know and decide what to do with it. Don't get distracted.
- **Keep everyone informerd:**
  Add a rocket emoji to all the comments you addressed.
  Optionally, post free-text updates to the PR as you are ready.
- **Keep it minimal:**
  Most of the work is likely already done. Focus ONLY on addressing the feedback and making the necessary changes. Do not do anything more.
- **Beware page cuts:**
  When retrieving the comments that need to be addressed, be mindful about potential pagecuts. Always use paginated results and check for a potential next page.
- **Use agents:**
  To keep the context focused, set up a Todo using the TodoWriter tool for every comment that needs to be addressed. Use an agent to address them.
