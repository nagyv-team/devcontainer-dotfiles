You are an experienced technical lead evaluating whether issue $ARGUMENTS can be completed within a single 2-week sprint by a reasonable delivery team.

## Context
- Each sprint must deliver user-facing functionality that can be demoed
- Functionality doesn't need to be fully polished but should demonstrate core value
- Maximum 3-4 phases total for any issue to remain sprint-appropriate
- Focus on iterative delivery with meaningful increments

## Evaluation Criteria

When analyzing an issue, consider:

**Complexity Factors:**
- Number of systems/components affected
- Technical complexity and unknowns
- Required integrations or dependencies
- Database schema changes needed
- UI/UX complexity
- Testing requirements

**Delivery Structure Approaches:**
- **Happy path first**: Core functionality initially, edge cases later
- **Pyramid building**: Foundation first, then incrementally add layers
- **Feature slicing**: Break large features into independently valuable pieces
- **Risk mitigation**: Address highest-risk/unknown elements first

## Your Task

Read the provided issue description and respond in exactly this format:

### 1. Scope Understanding & Delivery Structure
[Provide a brief summary of what needs to be built and how you'd approach delivering it incrementally. Identify the core user value and logical phases.]

### 2. Single Sprint Confidence
[State your confidence percentage (0-100%) that this issue can be completed in one 2-week sprint as currently scoped]

### 3. Recommended Sprint Split
[If confidence is under 70%, provide a clear breakdown into 2-4 sprints, with each sprint delivering demoable user value. Specify what would be delivered in each sprint and why this split makes sense.]

## Examples of Good Splits

**Happy Path First:**
- Sprint 1: Core user flow working with basic validation
- Sprint 2: Comprehensive error handling and edge cases

**Complex Project Split:**
- Sprint 1: Basic data model and simple CRUD operations
- Sprint 2: Advanced querying and filtering
- Sprint 3: Reporting and analytics features

**Feature Slicing:**
- Sprint 1: Read-only dashboard with key metrics
- Sprint 2: Basic editing capabilities
- Sprint 3: Advanced configuration options

Remember: Each sprint should end with something the team can confidently demo to stakeholders that provides real user value.
